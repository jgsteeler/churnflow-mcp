## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] - 2025-09-17

### 🎯 CRITICAL INTEGRATION: Complete Review System Workflow
**Connects CaptureEngine to ReviewManager, enabling the complete ADHD-friendly capture → review → action workflow**

### ✨ Added
- **ReviewManager Integration in CaptureEngine** - Low-confidence captures now route through ReviewManager instead of direct tracker writing
  - Replaces `routeToReview()` direct tracker writing with proper `ReviewManager.flagItemForReview()`
  - Automatic keyword extraction and metadata generation for enhanced review workflows
  - Confidence-based routing: < 0.7 threshold → ReviewManager, ≥ 0.7 → direct placement
  - Action items require higher confidence (0.8+) due to stricter validation criteria
- **Enhanced Review Metadata** - Comprehensive item preparation for human review
  - Keywords automatically extracted using `InferenceEngine.extractKeywords()`
  - Default urgency, type classification, and editable field configuration
  - Review status logic: "pending" vs "flagged" based on confidence levels
- **Graceful Fallback System** - Robust error handling ensures no thoughts are lost
  - If ReviewManager fails, automatically falls back to old tracker-writing behavior
  - Emergency capture maintains data integrity even during system failures

### 🔗 Fixed Integration Gaps
- **Broken Review Workflow** - Previously, low-confidence items bypassed ReviewManager infrastructure
- **CLI Review Command Isolation** - Review items weren't accessible via `npm run cli review`
- **Incomplete ADHD Workflow** - The capture → review → action → edit cycle was disconnected
- **Unutilized Review Metadata** - Confidence scoring and metadata weren't being leveraged

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **5 Comprehensive Integration Tests** - Complete end-to-end workflow validation
  - Low-confidence routing through ReviewManager
  - High-confidence bypass for direct placement
  - Keyword extraction and metadata preparation
  - Error handling and fallback scenarios
  - Configuration threshold validation
- **All 161 Existing Tests Pass** - Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Manual End-to-End Validation** - Confirmed complete workflow integration

### 🧠 ADHD-Optimized Results
- **Complete Workflow** - Now supports full capture → review → action → edit cycle
- **Human Oversight** - Low-confidence captures properly flagged for human review
- **Trust & Control** - Users can review and refine AI routing decisions
- **Zero Cognitive Overhead** - High-confidence items still bypass review for instant placement
- **Enhanced Metadata** - Keywords and context preserved for better review decisions

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before: Direct tracker writing bypassed ReviewManager
const success = await this.appendToReviewTracker(reviewEntry);

// After: Proper ReviewManager integration with metadata
const reviewItem = this.reviewManager.flagItemForReview(
  input.text,
  inference?.confidence || 0.1,
  inference?.primaryTracker || 'review',
  'actions',
  'capture',
  {
    keywords: this.inferenceEngine.extractKeywords(input.text),
    urgency: 'medium',
    type: inference?.generatedItems?.[0]?.itemType || 'review',
    editableFields: ['tracker', 'priority', 'tags', 'type']
  }
);
```

### 📈 Impact Metrics
- **Complete Integration** - CaptureEngine now properly utilizes all ReviewManager infrastructure
- **Enhanced CLI Access** - Review items accessible via `npm run cli review` command
- **Maintained Performance** - High-confidence items continue direct routing for zero friction
- **Production Ready** - Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 🏆 Key Achievement
**Complete Review System Integration** - ChurnFlow now provides the complete ADHD-friendly productivity workflow from capture to review to action. Low-confidence captures are properly flagged for human oversight while maintaining zero-friction direct placement for high-confidence items. This completes the critical missing link in the productivity system, ensuring users can trust AI decisions while maintaining control over their workflow.
