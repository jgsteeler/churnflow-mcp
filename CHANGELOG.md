## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-21

### üéâ Major Features Added

#### SQLite Database Integration
- **Full database integration** alongside existing file-based workflow
- **Dual storage system**: Captures save to both markdown files AND SQLite database
- **Optional database**: System works perfectly in file-only mode when database not set up
- **Proper architecture**: Database setup separated from capture operations

#### Database Features
- **Full-text search (FTS5)**: Search across all captures with ranking and relevance scoring
- **Analytics dashboard**: Track inbox, active, completed, and overdue items with real-time statistics
- **AI learning patterns**: Context inference improves over time with user feedback and pattern recognition
- **ADHD-friendly review system**: Intelligent prioritization of items needing review based on multiple factors
- **Context management**: Auto-create and manage contexts from tracker usage patterns

#### Database Commands
- `npm run db:setup` - Initial database setup with schema, indexes, and seed data
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database (deletes all data and recreates tables)
- `npm run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio database browser for visual exploration
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate database migrations from schema changes

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Architecture
- **Clean separation of concerns**: Database setup operations completely separated from capture business logic
- **Non-blocking database**: Capture operations succeed even if database operations fail
- **Graceful degradation**: Clear messaging and fallback when database unavailable
- **Proper error handling**: Database errors don't break existing file-based workflow

#### Database Schema
- **ISO date strings**: Consistent timestamp handling throughout (no more Unix timestamps)
- **Proper typing**: Full TypeScript integration with Drizzle ORM and type-safe queries
- **FTS integration**: Fixed trigger and column naming issues that caused SQLite datatype mismatches
- **Context-aware storage**: Captures properly linked to inferred contexts with relationship tables
- **Learning patterns**: AI improvement data stored for better context inference over time

#### Testing
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 10 new database tests covering all CRUD operations
- **Test isolation**: Temporary databases for each test with automatic cleanup
- **End-to-end testing**: Verified complete capture flow with dual storage system
- **Jest integration**: All tests passing with proper ESM configuration

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Database Issues Resolved
- **SQLite datatype mismatch**: Fixed FTS table column naming conflicts (contextTags vs context_tags)
- **Timestamp handling**: Consistent ISO date strings instead of problematic Unix timestamps
- **Schema conflicts**: Resolved trigger and virtual table issues that prevented inserts
- **Type safety**: Fixed TypeScript integration with Drizzle queries and proper return types
- **FTS triggers**: Fixed rowid issues and column mapping in full-text search triggers

#### Capture Flow Improvements
- **Emergency fallback**: Better error handling in capture failure scenarios with graceful degradation
- **Database availability**: System properly detects and handles missing database setup
- **File operation reliability**: Improved tracker writing with better error messages and validation

### üìã User Experience

#### Improved Workflow
- **Clear setup process**: Explicit `npm run db:setup` for database features (one-time operation)
- **Helpful error messages**: "Database not set up. Run: npm run db:setup" with clear guidance
- **Optional features**: Database features enhance but don't replace existing file workflow
- **Backwards compatibility**: Existing file-based workflow completely unchanged

#### Enhanced Capture Experience
- **Dual confirmation**: Clear indication when items saved to both files and database
- **Database feedback**: Success/failure messaging for database operations
- **File-first approach**: File operations remain primary, database provides enhancement features
- **Non-blocking saves**: Database failures don't prevent successful file captures

### üìö Documentation

## [0.3.4] - 2025-09-17

### üéØ CRITICAL INTEGRATION: Complete Review System Workflow
**Connects CaptureEngine to ReviewManager, enabling the complete ADHD-friendly capture ‚Üí review ‚Üí action workflow**

### ‚ú® Added
- **ReviewManager Integration in CaptureEngine** - Low-confidence captures now route through ReviewManager instead of direct tracker writing
  - Replaces `routeToReview()` direct tracker writing with proper `ReviewManager.flagItemForReview()`
  - Automatic keyword extraction and metadata generation for enhanced review workflows
  - Confidence-based routing: < 0.7 threshold ‚Üí ReviewManager, ‚â• 0.7 ‚Üí direct placement
  - Action items require higher confidence (0.8+) due to stricter validation criteria
- **Enhanced Review Metadata** - Comprehensive item preparation for human review
  - Keywords automatically extracted using `InferenceEngine.extractKeywords()`
  - Default urgency, type classification, and editable field configuration
  - Review status logic: "pending" vs "flagged" based on confidence levels
- **Graceful Fallback System** - Robust error handling ensures no thoughts are lost
  - If ReviewManager fails, automatically falls back to old tracker-writing behavior
  - Emergency capture maintains data integrity even during system failures

### üîó Fixed Integration Gaps
- **Broken Review Workflow** - Previously, low-confidence items bypassed ReviewManager infrastructure
- **CLI Review Command Isolation** - Review items weren't accessible via `npm run cli review`
- **Incomplete ADHD Workflow** - The capture ‚Üí review ‚Üí action ‚Üí edit cycle was disconnected
- **Unutilized Review Metadata** - Confidence scoring and metadata weren't being leveraged

### üß™ Testing & Quality

### üß† ADHD-Optimized Results
- **Complete Workflow** - Now supports full capture ‚Üí review ‚Üí action ‚Üí edit cycle
- **Human Oversight** - Low-confidence captures properly flagged for human review
- **Trust & Control** - Users can review and refine AI routing decisions
- **Zero Cognitive Overhead** - High-confidence items still bypass review for instant placement
- **Enhanced Metadata** - Keywords and context preserved for better review decisions

### üîß Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Before: Direct tracker writing bypassed ReviewManager
const success = await this.appendToReviewTracker(reviewEntry);

// After: Proper ReviewManager integration with metadata
const reviewItem = this.reviewManager.flagItemForReview(
  input.text,
  inference?.confidence || 0.1,
  inference?.primaryTracker || 'review',
  'actions',
  'capture',
  {
    keywords: this.inferenceEngine.extractKeywords(input.text),
    urgency: 'medium',
    type: inference?.generatedItems?.[0]?.itemType || 'review',
    editableFields: ['tracker', 'priority', 'tags', 'type']
  }
);
```

### üìà Impact Metrics
