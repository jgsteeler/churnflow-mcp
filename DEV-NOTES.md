# ChurnFlow Development Notes

## Current Status: v0.3.0 MCP Server Integration 🚀 READY FOR RELEASE

**Major Achievement**: Full GitHub Copilot integration with MCP server!

### v0.3.0 - MCP Server Integration ✅ COMPLETE:
- **MCP Server Implementation**: Production-ready Model Context Protocol server
- **GitHub Copilot Ready**: Three tools available - capture, status, list_trackers
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Any MCP-compatible AI can use ChurnFlow
- **Backward Compatible**: All v0.2.2 functionality preserved and enhanced
- **Production Grade**: Comprehensive error handling, configuration loading
- **Documentation Complete**: MCP-SETUP.md with integration guides

### What Works Perfectly:
- **Formatting Consistency**: All entries use standardized FormattingUtils
  - ✅ ISO dates (2025-09-16) and timestamps (2025-09-16 14:30)
  - ✅ Priority indicators (🚨 ⏫ 🔼 🔻)
  - ✅ Consistent entry templates for all types
- **Section Placement**: Items go exactly where they should
  - ✅ Automatic section creation with proper ordering
  - ✅ Activities sorted chronologically (oldest first)
  - ✅ Proper spacing (1 line before/after headers, no gaps between items)
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 122 tests across 6 suites ✅
- **Multi-item capture**: Doug welder example still works with new formatting
- **ADHD-friendly**: Brain dumps with consistent, clean output

## Next Version: v0.3.1 - Review Process System 🎯

**Focus: Follow-up Assurance over Perfect Routing**

Pragmatic approach: Ensure items get human attention rather than perfect AI placement.
Key insight: If action items get done, activity logs get reviewed before sync, and refs/reviews land somewhere appropriate, exact tracker placement is less critical.

### Core Requirements:
1. **Surface low-confidence items** that weren't routed immediately
2. **Dashboard indicators** for items needing review
3. **Quick validation interface** for ALL items (even 95% confident AI routing)
4. **Easy corrections**: tracker switching, priority changes, tag management, type conversion
5. **Universal review command** for comprehensive item management
6. **MCP Integration**: Review tools available to AI assistants

### Implementation Plan: docs/v0.3.1-PLAN.md (renamed from v0.2.3-PLAN.md)
- Two-tier system: auto-placed with review flags + review queue for low confidence
- CLI commands for quick edits: move, priority, tags, type conversion
- Dashboard integration with review indicators
- MCP server tools for AI assistant review workflows
- Focus on workflow completion rather than routing perfection

## v0.2.2 Formatting Consistency ✅ COMPLETED

### 🎯 Goal Achieved: Complete formatting standardization with perfect section placement

**Issues RESOLVED:**
- ✅ Standardized date formats: `2025-09-16` and `2025-09-16 14:30`
- ✅ Consistent checkbox styles and entry prefixes
- ✅ Proper section headers with spacing rules
