# ChurnFlow Development Notes

## Current Status: v0.4.0 SQLite Database Integration 🎉 PRODUCTION READY

**Major Achievement**: Complete database integration with clean architecture!

### v0.4.0 - Database Integration ✅ COMPLETE:
- **SQLite Database Integration**: Full dual storage (files + database) with graceful fallback
- **Full-Text Search (FTS5)**: Search across all captures with ranking and relevance
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time statistics for inbox, active, completed, and overdue items
- **AI Learning Patterns**: Context inference improves over time with user feedback
- **Clean Architecture**: Database setup completely separated from capture operations
- **Production Commands**: `npm run db:setup`, `npm run db:reset`, `npm run db:studio`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 176+ tests including full database test suite
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Complete backwards compatibility with file-only mode

### What Works Perfectly:
- **Database Integration**: Dual storage system with SQLite
  - ✅ Optional setup: Works in file-only mode when database not configured
  - ✅ Full-text search (FTS5) with proper triggers and indexing
  - ✅ Context-aware storage with relationship tracking
  - ✅ AI learning patterns for improved inference over time
  - ✅ Analytics dashboard with real-time statistics
- **Clean Architecture**: Database operations properly separated
  - ✅ Setup commands: `npm run db:setup` and `npm run db:reset`
  - ✅ Capture operations never create tables (code smell resolved)
  - ✅ Graceful degradation when database unavailable
  - ✅ Non-blocking database saves don't affect file operations
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 176+ tests across 7 suites ✅
- **Production Ready**: All existing features preserved and enhanced
  - ✅ Formatting consistency with FormattingUtils
  - ✅ Section placement and multi-item capture
  - ✅ MCP server integration and GitHub Copilot support
  - ✅ ADHD-friendly workflows with zero breaking changes

## Next Version: v0.4.1 - Database CLI Integration 🎯

**Focus: Expose Database Power Through User Interface**

Now that the database foundation is solid, make the advanced features accessible through CLI commands and MCP tools.

### Core Requirements:
1. **Database CLI Commands**: Search, analytics, and review queries from command line
2. **MCP Database Tools**: Expose database features through GitHub Copilot integration
3. **Enhanced Dashboard**: Database-powered statistics and insights
4. **Search Interface**: Full-text search integration with CLI
5. **Review Queries**: Database-backed review prioritization accessible via commands
6. **Analytics Commands**: Real-time statistics and progress tracking

### Implementation Plan: docs/v0.4.1-PLAN.md
- CLI commands: `search`, `stats`, `review-db`, `analytics`
- MCP tools: `search_captures`, `get_analytics`, `get_review_items`
- Database-powered dashboard with live statistics
- Full-text search with ranking and filtering
- AI learning pattern analysis and insights
- Integration with existing review system

## v0.2.2 Formatting Consistency ✅ COMPLETED

### 🎯 Goal Achieved: Complete formatting standardization with perfect section placement

**Issues RESOLVED:**
- ✅ Standardized date formats: `2025-09-16` and `2025-09-16 14:30`
- ✅ Consistent checkbox styles and entry prefixes
- ✅ Proper section headers with spacing rules
- ✅ Activity entries sorted chronologically (oldest first)
- ✅ Items placed directly under correct section headers
- ✅ Automatic section creation with proper ordering

### 📋 Formatting Standards IMPLEMENTED:

**FormattingUtils Class:** 52 comprehensive tests ✅

**Section Placement:** 12 comprehensive tests ✅  
- Proper blank line spacing (1 before/after headers, none between items)
- Standard section ordering: Activity Log → Action Items → Review → References → Someday → Notes
- Mixed content handling and edge cases

### 🔧 Implementation COMPLETED:
1. ✅ **FormattingUtils constants** with comprehensive standards
2. ✅ **InferenceEngine updated** to use FormattingUtils for consistent output
3. ✅ **TrackerManager enhanced** with section placement and validation
4. ✅ **Formatting validation** prevents inconsistencies
5. ✅ **All generated entries** use new standards  
6. ✅ **Comprehensive tests** - 122 tests across 6 suites
7. ✅ **Legacy test compatibility** maintained
