# Development Tracker Updates

## Overview

During ChurnFlow development, we maintain several external trackers in `/Users/jack/code/Collections/Churn/tracking/` that document progress at different organizational levels. These trackers serve as living documentation of the project's evolution and business impact.

## Tracker Hierarchy & Detail Levels

### üîß **churn-mcp-tracker.md** - Technical Detail (HIGH)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive technical documentation of ChurnFlow development
- **Detail Level**: High - includes specific features, test counts, implementation details
- **Update Frequency**: After major milestones, version releases, significant technical achievements
- **Audience**: Developers, technical stakeholders, future development reference

**Content includes**:
- Detailed activity log with technical milestones
- Specific action items with completion dates
- Architecture documentation and component descriptions
- Comprehensive roadmap with version details
- Test coverage and technical metrics

### üè¢ **gsc-prod-tracker.md** - Business Impact (MEDIUM)
- **Purpose**: Business division progress and market positioning updates
- **Detail Level**: Medium - focuses on business value, market advantages, competitive positioning
- **Update Frequency**: Major releases, significant business milestones
- **Audience**: Business stakeholders, GSC-PROD division tracking

**Content includes**:
- Business milestone achievements
- Market positioning and competitive advantages
- Technical roadmap from business perspective
- Customer/user impact potential

### üèõÔ∏è **gsc-llc-tracker.md** - Corporate Overview (LOW)
- **Purpose**: High-level corporate impact and IP portfolio updates
- **Detail Level**: Low - brief strategic updates, corporate asset development
- **Update Frequency**: Major version releases, significant corporate milestones
- **Audience**: Corporate level, high-level business overview

**Content includes**:
- Brief strategic achievement summaries
- Corporate IP and competitive advantage notes
- High-level division performance indicators

### ‚öôÔ∏è **churn-system-tracker.md** - System Management (LOW-MEDIUM)
- **Purpose**: ChurnFlow system improvements and infrastructure changes
- **Detail Level**: Low-Medium - system-level changes, infrastructure updates
- **Update Frequency**: System improvements, infrastructure changes
- **Audience**: System administrators, operational stakeholders

**Content includes**:
- System stability and functionality updates
- Infrastructure improvements
- Integration capabilities

## Update Guidelines

### When to Update
- **Major Version Releases** (v0.3.0): Update all trackers
- **Significant Milestones** (GitHub Copilot integration): Update churn-mcp + gsc-prod + gsc-llc
- **Technical Achievements** (122 tests passing): Update churn-mcp + churn-system
- **Business Milestones** (first-to-market advantage): Update gsc-prod + gsc-llc

### Detail Level Guidelines
- **churn-mcp**: Include version numbers, test counts, specific features, technical architecture
- **gsc-prod**: Focus on business impact, market positioning, competitive advantages
- **gsc-llc**: Brief strategic summaries, corporate IP development
- **churn-system**: System capabilities, integration status, operational improvements

### Consistency Notes
- Use consistent date format: `[2025-09-16]`
- Use emoji indicators for major milestones: üéâ üöÄ üéÜ ‚úÖ
- Maintain activity log chronological order (newest first)
- Update action items with completion dates when applicable
- Keep roadmaps aligned across trackers with appropriate detail levels

## Development Process Integration

### During Feature Development
1. Focus development work in ChurnFlow repository
2. Maintain detailed notes in repository (DEV-NOTES.md, commit messages)
3. Update external trackers at logical milestone points

### After Major Milestones
1. Update **churn-mcp-tracker.md** with comprehensive technical details
2. Update **gsc-prod-tracker.md** with business impact summary
3. Update **gsc-llc-tracker.md** with brief corporate-level summary
4. Update **churn-system-tracker.md** if system capabilities changed

### Benefits of This Approach
- **Reduces Context Switching**: Focus on development, batch tracker updates
- **Maintains Documentation**: Progress captured at appropriate organizational levels  
- **Supports ADHD-Friendly Workflow**: Clear stopping points, manageable update sessions
- **Preserves Business Context**: Technical work connected to business value
- **Future Reference**: Comprehensive development history maintained

## ADHD-Friendly Reminder

**It's okay to update trackers after development sessions rather than during them.** The goal is to maintain momentum during development and document progress at natural stopping points. Batch tracker updates reduce context switching and cognitive overhead.
