   - Test tracker switching scenarios

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test system performance with large tracker files
   - Test memory usage with many review items
   - Test concurrent CLI operations

### Phase 4: Quality & Polish (Days 8-9)
**Goal**: Production readiness and user experience improvements

1. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Better error messages with actionable guidance
   - Graceful degradation when components fail
   - Enhanced logging for debugging
   - User-friendly error recovery suggestions

2. **CLI UX Enhancements**
   - Progress indicators for long operations
   - Better confirmation prompts
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Improved help text and examples

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Lazy loading of tracker data
   - Caching for repeated operations  
   - Reduced memory footprint
   - Faster initialization times

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with v0.3.1 features
   - Add troubleshooting guide
   - Create usage examples and tutorials
   - Update API documentation

## Testing Targets by Component

### CLI Testing (src/cli.ts)
- **Target Coverage**: 80%
- **Priority Tests**:
  - Command parsing and validation
  - Interactive review workflows
  - Configuration loading and initialization
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Output formatting and colors

### MCP Server Testing (src/index.ts)  
- **Target Coverage**: 75%
- **Priority Tests**:
  - Tool implementation and responses
  - Server lifecycle management
  - Error handling and responses
  - Configuration integration
  - Protocol compliance

### Core Logic Enhancement (src/core/)
- **Current Coverage**: ~87% (excellent)
- **Target Coverage**: 90%
- **Focus Areas**:
  - TrackerManager file operations
  - ReviewManager edge cases
  - Error conditions and recovery

## Success Metrics

### Code Coverage
- **Overall**: 80%+ (from 56.6%)
- **CLI**: 80%+ (from 0%)
- **MCP Server**: 75%+ (from 0%)
- **Core Logic**: 90%+ (from 87%)

### Quality Metrics
- All 161+ tests passing
- Clean TypeScript compilation
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks maintained

### User Experience
- Comprehensive error messages
- Clear documentation and examples  
- Smooth interactive workflows
- Fast system initialization (<2s)

## New Dependencies

### Testing Dependencies
```json
{
  "@types/inquirer": "^9.0.9",
  "jest-mock": "^29.7.0",
  "supertest": "^6.3.0",
  "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk-test-utils": "latest"
}
```

### Development Tools
- CLI output snapshot testing
- MCP protocol testing utilities
- Performance profiling tools
- Coverage reporting enhancements

## Risk Mitigation

### Testing Complexity
- **Risk**: CLI interactive testing complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use inquirer mocking and fixture data
- **Fallback**: Focus on core functionality testing first

### MCP Testing Challenges  
- **Risk**: MCP protocol testing complexity
- **Mitigation**: Use official MCP testing utilities
- **Fallback**: Mock MCP transport layer for unit testing

### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Tests slowing development workflow
- **Mitigation**: Separate unit vs integration test suites
- **Optimization**: Parallel test execution

### Scope Creep
- **Risk**: Feature additions during testing
- **Mitigation**: Focus on coverage goals first
- **Discipline**: Log enhancement ideas for v0.3.3

## Future Considerations (v0.3.3+)

### Advanced Testing
- End-to-end testing with real tracker files
- Load testing with large datasets
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Browser-based testing for MCP clients

### Production Monitoring
- Usage analytics and telemetry
